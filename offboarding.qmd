# Offboarding {#sec-offboarding}

![](assets/offboarding.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Everybody will, at some point, leave the group. Degrees are earned, jobs are obtained, super exciting! Having a clear offboarding process ensures there are no loose ends when a member leaves the lab, that others who might carry on work being done can do so most easily, and provides an opportunity to clarify any remaining steps (e.g. publication, future collaborations, etc).


## Exit Interview

Set up a dedicated time to meet with Dr. Smith and/or your main collaborator in the lab (if not a graduate student) to talk about your time in the lab, and to go through the below checklist to make sure these have been done. Besides the checklist, things to talk about include the best part of being in our team, whether you got the support you needed and what could we improve for mentoring and training someone in your role in the future. 

### Checklist for students, staff, and post docs

1.    Schedule exit interview with Dr. Smith
2.    Come prepared to discuss your experience: what you enjoyed the most, etc
3.    Ensure all data is backed up on ResVault or the POP server. Ensure that all data and critical code are documented; in particular, make sure there is clear documentation on what data/code needs to be reserved for pending papers. **Remove all unneeded data/code from ResVault and/or POP server**. 
4.    Return any university equipment (laptop, desktop, computer accessories, desk chairs, etc)
5.    Develop a clear plan for publishing any remaining papers/reports/documentation
6.    Return borrowed things to Dr. Smith (books, etc..)

## Project Documentation

Project work should be hosted either in ResVault, the POP server, or another approved, backed-up server (e.g., COP server, CVmedLab dropbox folder).

Each project should have an easily found README text file that provides information for others so they can navigate and use your work, and give contact information for authors (and any data creators/use restrictions if proprietary data). Ideally, the README should also include links to publications and presentations from the work.

## Publications and Presentations

Ensure that publications and presentations from your projects are archived in the appropriate folder on the CVmedLab dropbox folder.

## Data

Data used in support of your projects should be:

*   Saved in appropriate, non-proprietary format with accompanying metadata
*   Housed in an approved, backed-up location: ResVault, POP server, or other approved place (e.g., CVmedLab dropbox or COP server)
*   Linked and briefly described in the project README.

**When data are no longer needed**, it is imperative we minimize unnecessary data storage. Once a paper is published, and the project is not expected to generate any further publications/presentations, talk with Dr. Smith about whether the data can be destroyed or minimized.

## Code

Code used or developed for the project should be **complete and well-documented, including information in a README about what each file does and workflow to run the code, and saved on the same server as existing data**. If the project is completed, code should be backed up and stored on the CVmedLab dropbox, and the virtual machine should be wound down. Make sure to include Dr. Smith in discussions about closing virtual machines. 

## Timelines for publications

Science is not finished until it has been communicated. Hopefully, you will publish your results in the peer-reviewed literature so that others can learn and build from your work. During your exit interview, make a plan with Dr. Smith for remaining publications, including a timeline for submission. **This is especially critical for dissertation publications**.

## Turning in equipment

Ensure any lab equipment (e.g. computer and peripherals) you have been using has been returned to the lab, office furniture is present and accounted for. Make sure any problems with equipment are documented and that Dr. Smith has been made aware of them.

## Maintaining UF access

Typically, Gatorlink access is available for a short period (a few weeks to months) after graduation; however, the reality is that not all work may be totally complete by the time you graduate. So, if more time is needed to access data, etc. talk with Dr. Smith about extending access. In some cases, courtesy appointments may be made for alumni to continue a formal relationship with UF that allows for maintenance of access to your gatorlink account for a defined period of time.
